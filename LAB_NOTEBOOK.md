## 2026-08-21 - Environment build

**Goal.** Get detectron2 running. It cannot be built on Windows: it compiles C++
and CUDA extensions requiring MSVC and a matching CUDA Toolkit, neither present,
and upstream does not support Windows. Route chosen: WSL2 + Docker.

**Done.**

1. **WSL2 + Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS.** WSL 2.7.12 was already installed; no distro. User
   `benja` (uid 1000), passwordless sudo - WSL is not a security boundary, since
   `wsl -u root` already grants root from the Windows session with no auth.
2. **Docker Engine 29.7.2** from Docker's official apt repo. Not Docker Desktop.
3. **NVIDIA Container Toolkit 1.20.0.** No NVIDIA driver installed inside the
   distro - the Windows driver passes through at `/usr/lib/wsl/lib`. Installing a
   Linux driver would break that and would need redoing on every GPU change.
4. **Verified GPU passthrough:** `docker run --gpus all nvidia/cuda:12.4.1-base
   nvidia-smi` gives RTX 2080 Ti, 11264 MiB, driver 591.86.

**Problem: every `docker pull` failed.** Registry CDN resolves to both IPv4 and
IPv6; WSL's default NAT network has no IPv6 route, and containerd kept selecting
the IPv6 address.

Disabling IPv6 inside the distro did **not** fix it. glibc complied - `getent` and
`curl` correctly returned IPv4 only - but **containerd uses Go's pure resolver**,
which bypasses glibc/NSS and gai.conf entirely and queries AAAA itself. Also note
Docker 29 uses the containerd image store, so `containerd.service` does the
fetching and must be restarted too, not just `docker`.

**Fix:** the Windows host has genuine IPv6 (global addresses via router
advertisement). Set `networkingMode=mirrored` in `.wslconfig`, giving the distro
the host's network stack. A proper fix rather than suppression, and it also gives
localhost interop, which the plan's FastAPI endpoint will want.

**Image `m2/detectron2:cu124-torch251` (22.1 GB).**
Base `pytorch/pytorch:2.5.1-cuda12.4-cudnn9-devel`, matching the Windows `m2` conda
env so results are comparable. `devel` not `runtime` - nvcc is required.
detectron2 pinned to commit `a2f4a877` (2026-08-18); there has been no tagged
release since 0.6, so `main` is a moving target. Cloned rather than
`pip install git+...` so `projects/ViTDet` is on disk.

**Gotcha - the numpy pin silently failed.** The first build finished with
**numpy 2.4.6** despite an explicit early `pip install "numpy<2"`; a later
`pip install` layer re-resolved it upward. detectron2 still *imported* fine, so
this would have surfaced much later inside COCO evaluation, looking like a metrics
bug rather than an environment bug. Fixed with `PIP_CONSTRAINT`, which binds every
pip invocation in the image, plus a build-time assertion that fails the *build*.
Settled at numpy 1.26.4.

**Second gotcha:** Git Bash rewrites standalone absolute-path arguments into
Windows paths, so `wsl -u root -- bash /root/provision.sh` became
`C:/Program Files/Git/root/provision.sh`. Piping through `tr` made the pipeline
exit 0, so it looked successful while installing nothing. Wrap the command in
`bash -c` instead, and verify long installs by their stage markers, not exit code.

**Smoke test.** Pretrained Mask R-CNN R50-FPN on COCO val2017 `000000439715`
(people on horses): 15 instances - 1 horse at 1.000, 8 people, 3 umbrellas, 1
backpack. 0.51 GiB peak VRAM. No training; equipment check only.
Output: `~/m2/work/detectron2_verify.jpg`.

**GPU note.** Card present is an RTX 2080 Ti (11 GB, sm_75, Turing), not the A5000
24 GB the research plan assumes. Adequate for Weeks 1-2. Requirement stated: the
upgrade must be a hardware swap plus a driver update, nothing more. Accordingly the
image is compiled for `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="7.5;8.6+PTX"` and configs use fp16
rather than Ampere-only bf16.

## 2026-08-21 - Repo scaffolding (~/m2/repos/detection-lab)

**Goal.** A version-controlled home for the first tracked experiment, structured to
carry into the SpaceNet 2 baseline rather than be thrown away.

**Notable finding: detectron2 ships no W&B integration.** `detectron2/utils/events.py`
provides only `JSONWriter`, `TensorboardXWriter`, `CommonMetricPrinter`. So
`src/detlab/wandb_writer.py` supplies the missing writer, modelled directly on
`TensorboardXWriter` (events.py:141) - same smoothing window, same `_last_write`
guard, same responsibility to drain accumulated images.

Everything else uses documented extension points: `build_writers`
(defaults.py:502), `build_evaluator`, `build_hooks` (defaults.py:452), and
detectron2's own stock hooks (`EvalHook`, `BestCheckpointer`, `TorchMemoryStats`).
Nothing reimplemented that already exists upstream.

`balloon` needed a loader because it is not in the detectron2 repo and ships VIA
polygon annotations rather than COCO.

**Status:** scaffolding complete. Training blocked only on a W&B API key.

**W&B account diagnosis.** `wandb.ai/home` and `/settings` both redirect to the
marketing page. GitHub Settings > Applications shows the Weights & Biases OAuth
app authorized but **"Never used"** - the grant exists, but no sign-in was ever
completed through it, so no W&B account/entity exists and there is no workspace to
route to. Fix: wandb.ai/login, sign in with GitHub, complete the username step.
